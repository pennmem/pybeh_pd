# pybeh_pd
 
A lightweight wrapper around pybeh for easy analysis and plotting of free recall data with pandas and seaborn.
See the attached notebooks for examples of how to use this module and psifr test for comparison to a related package.

It is just a module not yet a package so import by adding the path, i.e.
```
import sys
sys.path.append('~/pybeh_pd')
import pybeh_pd as pb
```
